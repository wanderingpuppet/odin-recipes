    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Instant ramen becomes a nearly-instant burger bun in this fun, and tasty, spin on a traditional hamburger
        seasoned with soy sauce and sesame oil.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 (3 ounces) packages instant ramen noodles, flavor packet discarded</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3/4 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>3 slices American cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups arugula</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil; add ramen noodles. Boil, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender,
            about 3 minutes. Drain. Allow noodles to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Beat 2 eggs in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Stir noodles into eggs until evenly coated. Divide
            noodles into 6 burger-size ramekins or bowls. Place a sheet of plastic wrap directly over noodles and stack
            another bowl on top to flatten noodles. Refrigerate until firm, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix beef, soy sauce, and sesame oil in a bowl. Divide beef mixture into three equal portions and shape into
            patties.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Invert each ramen bowl,
            gently tapping the bottom of the bowl until ramen loosens, careful to maintain bun shape.</li>
        <li>Fry each ramen bun, without moving noodles, in hot oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip each bun
            and continue frying until crisp, 3 to 5 minutes more. Ramen bun should be crispy on one side and slightly
            softer on the other. Transfer buns to large plate with the crispy side up.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in the same skillet used to fry ramen over medium heat. Cook beef
            patties until burgers are lightly pink in the center, 3 to 5 minute per side. An instant-read thermometer
            inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Arrange a slice of American cheese over
            each burger and continue to cook until melted, about 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Mix ketchup and chile-garlic sauce in a small bowl; spread mixture over the crispy side of each ramen bun.
            Divide arugula over 3 ramen buns. Place burgers over arugula.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1 teaspoon oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat; fry remaining eggs one at a time, adding
            more oil as needed, until yolk is almost firm, about 1 minutes per side. Place egg over patty and top with
            remaining bun.</li>
    </ol>
